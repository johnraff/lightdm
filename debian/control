Recommends: xserver-xorg
Suggests: accountsservice, upower, xserver-xephyr
Provides: x-display-manager
Description: simple display manager
 An X display manager that:
  * Has a lightweight codebase
  * Is standards compliant (PAM, ConsoleKit, etc)
  * Has a well defined interface between the server and user interface
  * Fully themeable
  * Cross-desktop (greeters can be written in any toolkit)
 .
 Additional software can be useful along with LightDM:
  * xserver-xephyr can be used to add a nested X display by calling
   'dm-tool add-nested-seat`
  * upower can be used to suspend the computer from the display manager
  * accountsservice is used to populate a user list with addition information.
